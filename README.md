### Changelog

-  `0.1.0`: initial commit; [Technical Memo Documentation](http://fast-trips.mtc.ca.gov/library/T2-NetworkDesign-WorkingCopy-July2015V0.1.pdf)  
-  `0.2.0`: added additional required fields to [`transfers_ft.txt`](/files/transfers_ft.md) 
in order to support route-specific transfers and time-point precedence. [Technical Memo Documentation](http://fast-trips.mtc.ca.gov/library/T2-NetworkDesign-StaticCopy-Sept2015V0.2.pdf)  
-  `0.2.1`: changed time to be specified as HH:MM:SS from midnight instead of HH:MM:SS to be 
consistent with [GTFS]
-  `0.2.2`: updated file names that are not GTFS to ALL have `_ft` extension.
-  `0.2.3`: added optional file `bike_access_ft.txt`
-  `0.2.4`: decreased ambiguity in `transfers_ft.txt` and changed fields related to schedule creation to be optional.
-  `0.2.5`: consolidated `knr_ft.txt` and `pnr_ft.txt` into `drive_access_points_ft.txt`
-  `0.2.6`: make costs in consistent values across the specification, as defined in `fare_attributes_ft.md`. Fixes link to `fare_attributes_ft.txt`.
-  `0.2.7`: eliminates `fare_class` as an optional variable in `routes_ft.txt` to eliminate ambiguity
-  `0.2.8`: requires `transfers_ft` because it has distance. Blank `schedule_precedence` is no precedence either way.  Defaults times in `fare_rules_ft` can have label `default`.
-  `0.2.9`: many clarifications. Use `lot_lon` rather than `lot_long` in `drive_access_points_ft` for GTFS consistency.  
-  `0.3.0`: clarifications. Changed definition of `end_time`. Renamed `fare_class` to `fare_period`. Made optional files optional. 

# Specification

A GTFS-PLUS transit network consists of required and optional data files that together 
describe a network of transit service.  Files not denoted with `_ft` follow the same format 
as the General Transit Feed Specification - [GTFS].

A GTFS-PLUS transit network MUST include the following files:

Filename 			| Description										
----------			| -------------										
[`walk_access_ft.txt`](/files/walk_access_ft.md)	| walk access links									
[`transfers.txt`](/files/transfers.md)		| transfer links			
[`transfers_ft.txt`](/files/transfers_ft.md)| additional transit link information						
[`trips.txt`](/files/trips.md)				| transit vehicle trips								
[`trips_ft.txt`](/files/trips_ft.md)		| additional transit vehicle trip information		
[`routes.txt`](/files/routes.md)			| transit routes									
[`routes_ft.txt`](/files/routes_ft.md)		| additional transit route information				
[`stops.txt`](/files/stops.md)				| transit stops and stations											
[`stop_times.txt`](/files/stop_times.md)	| transit trip stop times  		
[`vehicles_ft.txt`](/files/vehicles_ft.md)	| transit vehicles									
[`agency.txt`](/files/agency.md)			| transit agency									
[`calendar.txt`](/files/calendar.md)		| transit schedule calendar							

A GTFS-PLUS transit network MAY include the following files:

Filename 					| Description										
----------					| -------------		
[`drive_access_ft.txt`](/files/drive_access_ft.md)					| drive access links  
[`bike_access_ft.txt`](/files/bike_access_ft.md)					| walk access links  
[`drive_access_points_ft.txt`](/files/drive_access_points_ft.md) 	| park and ride access links; must be included if provide drive access links.  
[`shapes.txt`](/files/shapes.md)								 	| transit route shape points  
[`stops_ft.txt`](/files/stops_ft.md)						    	| additional transit stop and station information	
[`stop_times_ft.txt`](/files/stop_times_ft.md)	                    | additional transit trip stop time information	 
[`fare_attributes_ft.txt`](/files/fare_attributes_ft.md)			| fare attributes  
[`fare_rules.txt`](/files/fare_rules.md)							| fare rules  
[`fare_periods_ft.txt`](/files/fare_periods_ft.md)						| additional fare rules  
[`fare_transfer_rules_ft.txt`](/files/fare_transfer_rules_ft.md)	| fare transfer rules  
[`zones_ft.txt`](/files/zones_ft.md)	                            | zone locations
