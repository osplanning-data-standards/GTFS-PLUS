## Fare Transfer Rules

Examples of how to specify various fare schemes can be found in the [fares page](../fares.md).

 *  Filename MUST be `fare_transfer_rules_ft.txt`
 *  File MUST contain a record for each transfer rule for fares.
 *  File MUST be a valid CSV file.
 *  The first line of each file MUST contain case-sensitive field names.
 *  Field names MUST NOT contain tabs, carriage returns or new lines.
 

File MUST contain the following attributes:

| Required Attributes	 | Description										
| ----------			     | -------------		
| `from_fare_period`	 | An ID that identifies the `fare_period` that the passenger is coming from.  
| `to_fare_period`	   | An ID that identifies the `fare_period` that the passenger is going to.  
| `transfer_fare_type` |   One of:
| `-`                  |   `transfer_cost`:  assumes that the full value fare is not paid again  
| `-`                  |   `transfer_discount`:   is a subtraction from the cumulative fare  
| `-`                  |   `transfer_free`:  is a ridiculous way to say "free transfer"  
|`transfer_fare`		   |  If `transfer_fare_type` `==` `transfer_free`, this column is ignored.  Otherwise, this must be a non-negative value in whatever the fare currency that is added to the initial fare (in the case of a `transfer cost`) or subtracted from the combined fare of the segments (in the case of `transfer discount`).
